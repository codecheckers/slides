Wikipedia:
&gt; The concept of T-shaped skills, or T-shaped persons is a metaphor used in job recruitment to describe the abilities of persons in the workforce. The vertical bar on the letter T represents the depth of related skills and expertise in a single field, whereas the horizontal bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and to apply knowledge in areas of expertise other than one's own.

## Research compendia

&gt; ### ...We introduce the concept of a _compendium as_ both _a container for_ the different elements that make up the document and its computations (i.e. _text, code, data, ..._), and as a means for _distributing_, _managing_ and _updating_ the collection.

## Research compendia

#### Ram (2019), [How To Make Your Data Analysis Notebooks More Reproducible](https://github.com/karthik/rstudio2019)

- small, medium, large compendia

--

- Stick with the conventions of your peers
- Keep data, methods and outputs separate
- Specify your computational environment as clearly as you can

--

- Leverage the R package structure and support tools/services as much as possible
- Use modern tools to make your compendia more accessible ([repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker/), [containerit](https://o2r.info/containerit/), [holepunch](https://github.com/karthik/holepunch), [drake](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/))
- Don't forget long-term archives and simpler formats ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/))

???

**YMMV**

- "conscious" project creation

**key principles**

  - conventions &gt; "reader perspective" (How to Read...)

**take home messages**

  - R Markdown is really powerful, multi-language &gt; have one control script
  - don't obsess about "once click reproduce", but from time to time that should work!

**working openly and reproducibliy can be scary**

------

- clear benefits!
- transparency = effectivity
- open science = science
- reproducible research = research

------

We would therefore love to invite one of you to do a short (10-15min) talk for our event, We’d particularly welcome something on research compendia and best practice in creating them. Some feedback we’ve been getting is that although people learned a lot from working with the submitted materials, much of the insight gained comes from struggling with it (ie what not to do). It seems while all the good intention is there, we are still some way from even papers that the authors consider reproducible being actually reproducible by other researchers. So It would be nice to provide some theory and examples of best practice to give better insight into what participants should be aiming to for with their own work.

What I would say would be most useful for our participants would be tips for preparing their work as a research compendium to pass code check.exe

# The four CODECHECK principles

Four principles to give the intention and spirit.
_No certification of someone doing a CODECHECK,_ everything is open.

---
class: center, inverse

# The four CODECHECK principles

### 1. Codecheckers record but don’t investigate or fix.

--

### 2. Communication between humans is key.

--

### 3. Credit is given to codecheckers.

--

### 4. Workflows must be auditable.

--

### &amp;nbsp;

&lt;img style="border: 10px solid white;" src="https://codecheck.org.uk/img/codeworks-badge.svg"&gt;

???

**In a nutshell**: at one point in time, a codechecker puts their name under a report that describes what they did and what they achieved. Not "one click", no mandatory containers, no open source requirement, no cool infrastructure (and believe me I love cool computing infrastructures).

### Research Compendia make this a lot less complicated!

-----

1. A codechecker is _not_ required to fix workflows, but to document the given state of documentation and executability. Of course, given a level of interested and skills, a codechecker may go beyond simple small fixes and actively collaborate with an author to create a better research output. The codechecker's report provides helpful input to the scientific review, e.g., to help the reviewer's understanding. But a CODECHECK does not evaluate scientific merit! A failed CODECHECK does not imply the rejection of a submission.
  - _Not_ fixing, but _document_ state
  - Interest + skills = collaboration &amp; improvement
  - **Report** informs the scientific review, but not evaluate scientific merit!
  - Failed check != rejection
  - **Codechecker take the pictures at a crime scene, they do not hunt the murderer.**
2. The priority in all documentation and metadata is that a human codechecker can understand them. The codechecker is _not_ making a scientific judgement. It is also close to impossible to make a CODECHECK blind. Therefore a CODECHECK must not be anonymised must provide a two-way means of communication between author and codechecker. Codecheckers are supported by formal metadata, automation, and reproducibility infrastructure, yet the CODECHECK shall not rely on them. Codechecks may be conducted by existing stakeholders in the submission process (e.g., a reviewer), but may also be handled with new roles and by people underrepresented in classic peer-review, such as early career researchers (ECRs) or research software engineers (RSEs).
3. Common sense and a collaborative process are the main drivers behind the level of documentation, the degree of openness, and the amount of data that is checked. But the minimal requirement is that the codechecker has enough material to validate the workflow submitted by the authors. This means the code could be executed once by following the provided instructions and selected outputs, e.g. figures or data files, are created. Ideally, the execution is fully scripted, and the execution can be triggered by a running a single command. Being executed once means that a detailed investigation may occur at a later time. Being auditable includes that authors provide data and code for relevant analysis steps and visualisations to the codecheckers, but does not imply that all of the code associated with an article must be checked. The CODECHECK is not automated on purpose: automation may lead to people gaming the system, and may hide details that eventually decrease level of certainty that a codechecker has in their assessment.
  - Software is **crucial** for research
  - Check is **contribution** to the scientific body of knowledge
  - If part of a review process
    - **publisher** ensures creditation equal to scientific reviewer
    - methods section _statement_
    - deposited metadata (not report):
        - codechecker's ORCID
        - time, journal
        - (article DOI)
  - **DOI**-able report, URL in _statement_

- Post review with extra role (ECR opportunity)
- Pre-review with extra role on staff
- Parallel reproducibility reviewer (flexible skill match)
- Regular reviewer (not widely established during last 10 years ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ )
- Independent community pre-review **at ReproHacks or for preprints**

https://codecheck.org.uk/process/

???

Four dimensions:

- Who does the review?
- When does it happen?
- How transparent is it?
- How fast does it need to be?

**Are you involved in any journal or conference where this is, or could be, applied?**

### Post review with extra role

1. A manuscript with computations passes scientific peer-review and is assigned a codechecker with matching expertise (first priority: code, second priority: domain).
1. The codechecker must understand the instructions and executes the workflow using the CODECHECK infrastructure.
   They contact the manuscript author if needed and collaborate based on the CODECHECK infrastructure.
1. A CODECHECK evaluates if the code and data produce a core output (figure, dataset) - it is _not_ a result check or judgement of scientific merit.
1. The codechecker makes the final call on the result within a week, publishes the checked code and data together with the environment in a public repository (with DOI), and puts their name on it. A &lt;img src="/img/codeworks-badge.svg" alt="CODECHECK badge" height="16" style="margin-top: -4px;" /&gt; badge on the published article points to the repository with the checked files.

### Pre-review with extra role on staff

1. An editorial staff member/ECR with technical expertise checks if something is "mechanically wrong" before sending out a submission to review.
   This is worth the time together with other technical checks! The codechecker can reach out to the author to fix problems.
   It is also a sanity check for the author and a measure of seriousness for the journal.
1. If a CODECHECK is successful, start the regular review.
1. After acceptance, add &lt;img src="/img/codeworks-badge.svg" alt="CODECHECK badge" height="16" style="margin-top: -4px;" /&gt; badge to the published article.

### Parallel reproducibility reviewer

1. A manuscript is submitted to a journal or conference.
1. It is assigned a scientific reviewer with the suitable domain expertise, and a codechecker with matching technical expertise.
   The scientific review is conducted open/single-blind/double-blind, while the codechecker knows the author and can reach out directly through the best channel, e.g. email, GitHub/GitLab issues, or discussion forums.
1. Both reviewer and codechecker follow the same deadline.
1. Both the scientific review and the CODECHECK result are submitted to the handling editor or programme committee member, who makes the decision on how to proceed.
1. Independent of the submissions acceptance, the CODECHECK findings are sent to the submitting author.

### Regular reviewer

The review process is conducted as usual, but the editor does not only match the domain expertise but also technical skills.
The reviewer conducts the CODECHECK and submits the resulting certificate as part of his report.
This variant requires an open peer review and a broad pool of reviewers.

### Independent community pre-review

An author may also reach out to a colleague or find a [Code Copilot](https://twitter.com/Code_Copilot) on Twitter, who can give feedback but also create a CODECHECK report according the a journal's/conference's implementation of the principles.
This report certainly increases trust in a workflow and may help authors to include code and data in their submission.
Such an independent report may even be taken up during review and take the place of a report usually created by a different process described on this page.

### More?

You have ideas about how a CODECHECK would work for your journal or conference? _Let us know !_

???

In our discussions with editors and publishers, we found that the _point in time_ during the review process when a CODECHECK happens, the person who takes the role of codechecker, and the openness of the codechek, can vary.
For example, the check may happen before peer review or after, the codechecker can be staff, a regular reviewer, or a member of a special reproducibility committee, the check may be open or blind, either matching or differing from the scientific review, and the results may be published or confidential.

#### Rule 1: Have a README: all else is details.[*](http://teachtogether.tech/)

--

#### _low tech &amp; high tech_ approaches exist (CODECHECK &amp; o2r, [and more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00484)), but we need individuals to be leaders and you can be one by adjusting your habits

--

#### _burden_ mostly on author, but _benefits_ clear and immediate &gt; start early {in career, in project}

--

#### _marathon_ to change habits and community practice &gt; must push as individuals to achieve the needed _cultural change_
