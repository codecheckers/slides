## How to add a talk

- Create a directory `YYYY-MM_EVENT`
- If you only have a PDF, add it to the directory
- If you have sources and output files, put the sources in the directory and render the output files to the `/docs` directory; the `/docs` directory is published as a GitHub page, so you can access files directly at `https://codecheck.org.uk/slides/<FILE NAME IN DOCS DIRECTORY>`
